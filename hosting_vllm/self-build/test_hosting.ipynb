The metrics include revenue, cost of sales, gross profit, and other financial items. Here is a breakdown of the content:\\n\\n### Year Ended December 31, 2022\\n- **Revenue**: 280,044.0 million\\n- **Cost of sales**: (232,466.8) million\\n- **Gross profit**: 47,577.2 million\\n- **Research and development expenses**: (16,028.1) million\\n- **Selling and marketing expenses**: (21,323.3) million\\n- **Administrative expenses**: (5,113.9) million\\n- **Fair value changes on investments measured at fair value through profit or loss**: (1,662.0) million\\n- **Share of net losses of investments accounted for using the equity method**: (400.1) million\\n- **Other income**: 1,135.5 million\\n- **Other losses, net**: (1,368.8) million\\n- **Operating profit**: 2,816.5 million\\n- **Finance income/(costs), net**: 1,117.5 million\\n- **Profit before income tax**: 3,934.0 million\\n- **Income tax expenses**: (1,431.4) million\\n- **Profit for the year**: 2,502.6 million\\n- **Non-IFRS Measure: Adjusted net profit**: 8,518.0 million\\n\\n### Year Ended December 31, 2021\\n- **Revenue**: 328,309.1 million\\n- **Cost of sales**: (270,048.2) million\\n- **Gross profit**: 58,260.9 million\\n- **Research and development expenses**: (13,167.1) million\\n- **Selling and marketing expenses**: (20,980.8) million\\n- **Administrative expenses**: (4,738.9) million\\n- **Fair value changes on investments measured at fair value through profit or loss**: 8,132.1 million\\n- **Share of net losses of investments accounted for using the equity method**: 275.0 million\\n- **Other income**: 826.9 million\\n- **Other losses, net**: (2,579.5) million\\n- **Operating profit**: 26,028.6 million\\n- **Finance income/(costs), net**: (1,611.6) million\\n- **Profit before income tax**: 24,417.0 million\\n- **Income tax expenses**: (5,133.8) million\\n- **Profit for the year**: 19,283.2 million\\n- **Non-IFRS Measure: Adjusted net profit**: 22,039.5 million\\n\\n### Analysis\\nThe document provides a detailed comparison of the company's financial performance over two consecutive years. Key metrics such as revenue, gross profit, operating profit, and adjusted net profit are highlighted. The revenue for 2022 is significantly lower than in 2021, reflecting a decrease in operational activity or market conditions. Similarly, the gross profit margin for 2022 shows a decrease compared to 2021.\\n\\nThe research and development expenses, selling and marketing expenses, and administrative expenses for 2022 are also lower than in 2021. This trend could indicate cost savings or efficiency improvements in these areas. However, the fair value changes on investments measured at fair value through profit or loss show a significant decrease in 2022, which might be due to market conditions or changes in investment values.\\n\\nThe other income and other losses, net, also indicate a significant change, which could impact the overall profitability and financial health of the company. The operating profit for 2022 is notably lower than in 2021, which might indicate challenges in the core business operations.\\n\\nThe financial information provided in this MD&A document is crucial for stakeholders, including investors, to understand the company's performance and financial health over the two-year period.\"\n",
